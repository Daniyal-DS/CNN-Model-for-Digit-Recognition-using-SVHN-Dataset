# CNN-Model-for-Digit-Recognition-using-SVHN-Dataset
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed to recognize digits (0-9) from images in the Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset. SVHN is a real-world image dataset obtained from Google Street View, containing over 600,000 labeled images of house numbers in urban environments.
